This program will be designed to calculate the runs created for the ABL simulation basebal league. 

Program will utilize a simulation league's season stat file as input.  The file will contain the player's name, and their relevant statistical information, which for this program will consist of the following data:

At bats
Hits
Doubles
Triples
Home Runs
Walks

The basic runs created formula is Runs Created = ((Hits + Walks) X Total Bases)/(At bats + walks)

The statistic is used to evaluate how many runs the batter contributed to creating for his team.
